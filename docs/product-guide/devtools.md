Important to Wisdom is the ability to replay low level logs, to debug root cause of various incidents. Inside the replay gallery, you may open Wisdom's dev tools view by clicking on the small purple control bar just above the bottom of the screen on the media bar.

There are five main components to the developer tools:
 - **Logs**: Shows complex logs recorded during the session- including network requests and redux actions, when enabled.
 - **Details**: Displays basic info about the recorded session.
 - **Network**: Shows network request performance timing for various network requests, such as images, fonts, XHR/Fetch, scripts, videos etc.
 - **Storage**: Displays cookies, localstorage and session storage.
 - **HTML**: Showing a full tree of HTML elements and nodes.
