### I don't have a User Identity ID available, can I use Wisdom without one?
Wisdom works best on apps after users have logged-in. If you do not have an Identity ID available, the Live Users page will list the active customers, but the Intercom integration will not work because the script will have no way of distinguishing who is who.

### I installed the code, but when I test Wisdom's Live View locally, assets are missing and it doesn't look right.
Wisdom requests CSS assets from a server and requires internet access to build the Live View accurately. Rather than using localhost, we recommend using a staging server to test live view and co-browsing features.

### How can I fully test Wisdom without deploying my application?
We recommend testing Wisdom in a staging environment, publicly accessible to the internet. You can also test live from within the dev tools console.

### Does Wisdom work on mobile?
Yes, Wisdom works well with mobile and tablet web applications.

### Does Wisdom work on native mobile applicaitons?
Wisdom is currently optimized for web apps only.
