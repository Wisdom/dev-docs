Wisdom is your modern web analytics data lake, home to an exciting community of SaaS product builders who share and contribute custom reports.

Just add Wisdom's instrumenting JS code to your web application, and optionally grant Wisdom (read only) API keys to your favorite SaaS tools. Wisdom will create your own data warehouse custom built for your B2B SaaS web startups.

Wisdom has a simple scalable pricing model of _$47 per TB of storage per month_ and _$199 per group of million page views_. As a pricing benchmark, our median customer pays $280/month.

Getting Setup is simple:
1. Add Wisdom tracking code
2. BCC customer emails to your secret Wisdom email address (optional)
3. Add third party vendor API Keys to sync data, like Stripe and Zendesk (optional)
4. Watch your sessions!

While Wisdom is free to try with an open registration system, we've noticed the most succuessful companies reach out early on and book a video chat with our team. We would strongly advise a quick chat to see if Wisdom is right for your team, and how you can get the most out of Wisdom.

While most of the time the Wisdom tracking is installed without reaching out to us, it's not uncommon to have a meeting or two with dev teams to plan everything out- and we're happy to help out any way we can. Feel free to contact our dev team directly by emailing [devs@GetWisdom.io](mailto:devs@GetWisdom.io) with any questions you have and we'll get back to you by email- or video chat if you prefer. -->
