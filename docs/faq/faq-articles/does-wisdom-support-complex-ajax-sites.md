### Does Wisdom support complex AJAX sites?

Yes! Wisdom at it's core records all HTML and Browser State. Because Wisdom doesn't actually depend upon JavaScript state, it is compatible with all frameworks and site architectures such as `Wordpress`, `Angular`, & `React`. Wisdom goes further, with optional recording of HTML5 Canvases.

### Some advanced recording capabilities include:
- SVG & XML namespaces
- CSS Pseudo Selectors: `:Hover` `:Target` `::Select`
- Window dimensions, positions.
- HTML5 Video (No JS triggered support yet)
- Multitouch gestures & events
- CSS Keyframe Animations


### Limitations
There are however some technical and business limitations that do currently exist within the Wisdom system:
 - **Cross-Origin IFrames** - Wisdom Script must be running within all frame contexts
- **WebGL** - Under analysis for future business value.
- **Plugins such as Flash, Java, Silverlight, etc.** - Not planned to be supported
- **HTML5 Shadow DOM** - Under investigation for future development.
- **Web components** - Under investigation for future development.
