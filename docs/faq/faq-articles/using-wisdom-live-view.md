For website visitors who are currently active within your web application, Wisdom provides *Live View*. This is the default behaviour inside the user gallery. When in live mode, media controls like pause/seek/fastforward are naturally not available. In the timeline panel on the left hand side of the gallery, you may click the first sub-panel titled *"Live Mode"* to initiate live mode when currently viewing recorded sessions.
